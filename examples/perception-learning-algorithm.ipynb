    "# Perception Learning Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The _Perception Learning Algorithm_, also called PLA or __perceptron__ is the simplest and yet very powerful learning algorithm based on one neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this algorithm relies on two important concepts: the _input_ and its _weight_. Every input has its weight based on how important it is in the model. The PLA output to the machine is binary, either positive or negative and it is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\text{sign}\\left[ \\sum_{i = 0}^n w_ix_i \\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where in this case the value $w_0$ is the __threshold__ ($x_0$ is always 1) and the values $x_i$ and $w_i$ are the $i$-th values of the input and their respective weight. If we sum up all the $x_i$ and $w_i$ in two vectors, the formula is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\text{sign}\\left[ w^Tx \\right]\\, \\hspace{10px} \\text{where} \\hspace{10px} w = \\begin{bmatrix} w_0 & w_1 & \\cdots & w_n \\end{bmatrix}\\, \\hspace{10px} \\text{and} \\hspace{10px} x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\\\ x_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_n \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By hypothesizing that bot $w$ and $x$ are bi-dimensional, we can plot them into a plane and study the product between the two vectors. If the product is positive but should be negative, we try to rotate the $w$ vector to the negative part of the plane. If the product is negative and should be positive we try to rotate the $w$ vector to the positive half of the plane.\n",

    ">\n",
    "Another important thing is to define the __hyper-parameters__ such as the _number of iterations_. This is important because if the dataset is not _linear_, meaning that the dataset is not liberally separable. If it is not separable the algorithm will fall into an infinite loop in which it constantly tries to reach an unreachable solution. The hyperparameters of the model can also be optimized meaning that there is an optimal threshold for the algorithm. In this case, the threshold's value (<tt>steps</tt>) is $50$. "

It is important to note that, precisely because <tt>dataset</tt> is a list of lists, the <tt>elem</tt> variable contains a list. Inside the loop, the $y$ and $x$ coordinates are stored in local variables using the __slicing__ technique (<tt>elem[:3]</tt>).\n",
